# Isaac's Theme
## I have nothing to say here
I'm a fussy old crank and I'm easily confused by syntax themes other than this one, which is a **VSCode** port of an **Atom** port of a **Sublime 3** port of a **NotePad++** theme developed for internal use by a firm called Reknowned, about which I know nothing.

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets
