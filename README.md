# Isaac's Syntax Theme

I'm a fussy old crank and I'm easily confused by syntax themes other than this one, which is a **VSCode** port of an **Atom** port of a **Sublime 3** port of a **NotePad++** theme developed for internal use by a firm called Reknowned, about which I know nothing.

## Installation

One day perhaps this will be an installable VS Code extension, but for now:
- Copy the `themes` folder into  `~/.vscode/extensions/isaaclubow-theme`
- Full path should look like `~/.vscode/extensions/isaaclubow-theme/themes/isaaclubow-theme-color-theme.json`

**Enjoy!**
